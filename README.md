# deis-dashboard

Deis Dashboard is a "real time" only http connections dashboard for the [Open Deis PaaS](http://deis.io)

It is a personal exercise to learn go, this is my first go app ever.

* requires [deis-dashback](https://github.com/lorieri/deis-dashback)

## New

 * Upgraded to Deis 1.9.1
 * Added requests by Domain
 * Added upstream request times
 * Added request times

## How-to

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lorieri/deis-dashboard.git
$ cd deis-dashboard

# start the backend in the cluster
$ fleetctl start deis-dashback.service

# start the log collection
$ fleetctl start deis-dashcollect.service

# create and configure your app
$ deis create deis-dashboard
$ deis config:set ETCD_HOSTS=http://myhost1:4001,http://myhost2:4001,http://myhost3:4001

# deploy the app:
#
# there are two ways to deploy deis-dashboard, by its Dockerfile or by Docker Hub

# by Dockerfile
$ git push deis master

# *OR*
# by Docker Hub
$ deis pull lorieri/deis-dashboard

# open it
$ deis open
```

## Dashboard

If the instalation successed you may see the screen bellow, if you are not able to see your apps try sending some traffic in your cluster and wait for ~10 seconds

### Main Page

The Main Page shows 3 charts
 * A pie that shows the percentage of requests of the apps related to cluster total
 * A pie that shows the percentage of bytes transfered of the apps related to cluster total
 * A bar chart that shows total errors and total successed requests stacked by app

In the top right of the page there is a link for the current apps

The Apps Page show statistics for the last 10 seconds of traffic and 2 horizontal bars: 
  * total requests
  * % of successes / % of errors

## ToDo:

 * ~~add new keys from deis-dashback~~
 * fix echart toolbox legends
 * ~~create links to the apps~~
 * ~~put total requests on the main dashboard~~
 * ~~put total requests/s on the main dashboard~~ (unecessary divide by 10...)
 * ~~add etcd suport~~ to get router stats (waiting deis PR)
 * ~~add ENVs for confs~~
 * fix etcd nil values
 * ~~fix chart when no traffic~~

## Know Issues:

 * I'm new in go, goweb, bootstrap, etc...
 * There is a race condition in redis, sometimes an app appears twice
 * pay attention for the "last logline", it shows delays caused by poor performance
